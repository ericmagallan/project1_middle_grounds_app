# Middle Grounds App
Find the Middle Ground between you and your companions! (Group Project)

The idea behind this project is to find a middle point (based on gps) to meet with your friends.
The app would find the middle point between the two parties, and suggest places to meet near the area such as coffee shops, restaurants, etc.
